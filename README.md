# DeepFix: Explainable Privacy-Preserving Compression for X-ray Image Classification

- Claims (currently being verified)
  1 Good Predictive Performance:  Preserves necessary information for CheXpert classification.
  2 Explainability:  spatial attribution and attention maps without the original image.
  3 Privacy preserving: (a) no attribute disclosure (high image reconstruction error) AND (b) no identity disclosure (low probability of identifying a person with predictive models) 
  4 Compression:  work with very large files with negligible ram increase.
