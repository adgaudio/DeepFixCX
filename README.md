# DeepFix: Explainable Privacy-Preserving Compression for X-ray Image Classification

- Claims (currently being verified)
  - Good Predictive Performance:  Preserves necessary information for CheXpert classification.
  - Privacy preserving:  high reconstruction error AND low probability of identifying a person with predictive models
  - Explainability:  spatial attribution and attention maps without the original image.
  - Compression:  work with very large files with negligible ram increase.
